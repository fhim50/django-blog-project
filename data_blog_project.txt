The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a compact executive car produced by the Mercedes-Benz division of Daimler AG. First introduced in 1993 as a replacement for the 190 range (W201, also nicknamed “Baby-Benz”), the C-Class was the smallest model in the marque's lineup until the arrival of the A-Class in 1997. The C-Class is built at Mercedes-Benz factories in Sindelfingen and Bremen, Germany as well as in Mercedes' factories in Brazil[3] and Daimler AG's South African factory in East London. The very first W202 C-Class sedan was produced on June 1, 1993, and the second generation W202 C-Class rolled off the assembly line on July 18, 2000. The most recent fourth generation W204 C-Class was launched in 2007 after the success of the third generation W203 offered from 2000 to 2007. The C-Class is the entry-level offering in Mercedes-Benz's United States lineup.

Had a BMW 335i , switched to MB and got to say I look teh car. It is not as qiuck as teh BMW , but the ride and quility of teh car are way better

Pros: Very impressed with the handling, braking and acceleration of the C250 sport sedan considering it's a four-cylinder engine. It drives and handles like a six-cylinder, so smooth you can't hear or feel any wind/road noise. First time to drive and own a turbo-charged 4-cylinder car. Like the feel of 229 ft-lbs torque. Barely noticed any turbo lag. The instrumentation looks and feels very elegant.


Pros: I also leased a 2004 C240 for four years. Loved that car, but because of the style and the box look, I choose not to buy the car. Just got my C250 in December. Love, love, love this car. Love the style of the car and the performance. Plan to put 200,000 on this car!!
